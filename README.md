Efstratios Zafeirelis' Autohotkey Unscrambler

Q/A:
1. Why did you make this?

   I thought it'd make decent practice for autohotkey/
2. How do I run it?

   First and foremost, you need to have autohotkey installed (https://autohotkey.com/). 
   After installing AHK all you need to do is download the file, double click it and then click the "right alt" button to start.

3. How does it work?

   It utilizes another database.

4. Why autohotkey?

   Wanted to experiment with it.

Known issues:
   1) It cannot differentiate between anagrams (i.e brake, break, baker etc).
   2) It requires internet connection. Slightly intentional since I wanted it to be lightweight.
